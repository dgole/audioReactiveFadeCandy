# audioReactiveFadeCandy
# This repo started by cloning https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy
# all underlying code (opc, fastopc, etc) is not mine
# my additions are the ar, ledWall, bassGuitar, and musicTheory directories  
# How this should be organized:
# ar (audio-reactive) directory contains tools and libraries to be used in the implementation of patterns

# each project or configuration of lights gets its own directory.
# each directory should have
# 1 the .json file to configure the server
# 2 some sort of patterns.py file that contains the patterns as functions
# 3 some gui or script that implements the patterns
