# 1. around body (40 leds)
# 2. along neck top (20 leds)
# 3. along neck bottom (20 leds)
# 4. along strap (40ish)
# 4 fadecandy channels
# that's about 120 leds total
# 120 * 20 mA per color led = 2.4 A, exactly max for battery.  
# dial fadecandy whitepoint to 0.8 or so and we're good to max out 1 color.
